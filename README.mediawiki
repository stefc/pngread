== Managed C# PNG-Format Library == 

This source is sample code I write to read & write PNG Files without using the 'libpng' library.

It helps me a lot of studying the format and the usage of git with remote repositories.

It's works well with the following formats 

* 24-Bit RGB
* 8-Bit Grayscale
* 1-Bit Monochrome
